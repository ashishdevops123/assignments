1. Components of Docker and its Brief Summary
   DOCKER COMPONENTS:
   DOCKER ENGINE:
     Docker is an important component in docker which manges images, api request, networking, volumes.
   Docker swarm :
     Docker swarm is a orchestration just like kubernetes which manages the cluster of docker nodes( where docker is installed)
   Runtime constraints:
      low level runtime: runc
      high level runtime: containerd


2. What is the differenet between docker pause and unpause?
    Docker pause generally suspends all the process of the container keeping all the memory intact.
    Docker unpause generally resumes or unsuspends all the process of the container


3. What is the differenet between docker stop and kill?
       Docker stop will stops the container and deletes all the memory and cache of the container.
    Docker stop and docker kill both offers the same functionalities i.e., to make sure that container should not work.
    Docker stop sends a formal signal using SIGTERM which checks that container is not working and after a time gap it will give
    SIGkill so that it will not work.
    whereas Docker kill will directly send SIGKILL without any intimation to the container and abruptly the container gets shutdown.

4. What is the differenet between docker exec and attach?
   Docker container exec is used to enter into the container and execute the commands it can be done by 2 methods
   docker container exec <containerid> <command>
   or 
   docker container exec -it  <containerid> /bin/sh
   docker container exec -it  <containerid> /bin/bash
   After exiting out of the container , then also container is working.

   docker attach <containerid> is used to attach to the container which is detached to see the stand input/output
   and errors at the terminal 
   dissadvantage is if we attach to a container than it is not possible to keep the container alive after the exit.
   
   
    
5. List of dockerfile instructions and its Brief Summary?
6. What is the differenet between CMD vs Entrypoint
7. List of 20 docker commands and its use cases with example?
  
       docker image pull httpd  /  docker pull httpd
       docker image ls         /  docker images
       docker image rm httpd  /  docker rmi httpd
       docker create --name=ash1 httpd  / pulls httpd and tags 
       docker start ash1   /  starting a container using tag
       docker stop ash1   /    exiting a container using tag
       docker restart ash1  /  restarting a container using tag
       docker pause ash1   /   pauses a container using tag
       docker unpause ash1  /  unpauses a container using tag
       docker kill ash1   /  exiting a container using tag
       docker rm ash1     /  completely removing container using tag if we execute ( docker ps -a command )
       docker run -d httpd (or) docker container run -d httpd     both commands are same it pulls and runs container in detached mode
       docker container run -it ubuntu:focal /bin/bash            run the container and enter inside the container
       docker container exec <containerid> <command>  ======= u can execute command directly without going inside the container
       docker container exec -it <containerid> <command> /bin/bash  ==== u can get inside the container using the respective shell u use for executing command      
       docker inspect <containerid>    it will give all the  information about the container using containerid
       docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)   it will delete all the container forcefully in  one go witout stooping
       docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)  it will delete all the images in one go.
       docker commit <containerid> imagename:tag === image creation using the container
